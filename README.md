## Abstract
For our capstone project, we will be making a mobile app for the Kelley Cafe. The main purpose of this app is to allow PLU students to order food/drinks online as mobile orders. We plan to work with Kelley Cafe management and other PLU departments (such as David Allen who might have access to databases we need)  to get the information required. If we cannot acquire all of this information, a proof of concept will be made.

## Introduction
There is a big problem at this University; students want to get a drink or snack between classes but you canâ€™t because the lines are too long. Kelley Cafe workers get crazy rushes between classes while having a lot of downtime during classes. Our Kelley Cafe mobile app will help alleviate this issue for both students and Kelley Cafe workers. The application will make it easier and quicker for students to order and get food/drinks after classes, and it will also create a more manageable workload for the employees. 
We want students to be able to place their orders on a mobile app and for workers to have some sort of interface that displays the incoming orders so that they know what to make.
This project is critical to the success of the students at this university, it is a scientific fact that being hungry makes it harder to focus, which results in students performing worse in the classroom.
